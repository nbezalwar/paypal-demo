obDdaBody	                            = <p>1.   Authorization to Debit Account. I hereby authorize PayPal to issue pre-authorized debits drawn on the bank account (the "Account") added to my PayPal Account for my personal or business use. Such pre-authorized debits are also referred to as "PADs". PayPal may issue PADs sporadically in a dollar amount that I indicate, up to a maximum of $200,000 CAD. PayPal may issue PADs in the amounts and with the frequency that I authorize from time to time based on my agreement with PayPal and/or certain merchants. I acknowledge that to add an Account to my PayPal Account for PADs, I must confirm my Account through PayPal's three step bank account confirmation process as described at https://www.paypal.com/row/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/dmo/demo_rd_1.</p><p>2.  Cancellation. I understand that I may cancel this authorization for future transactions at any time by removing the Account from my PayPal Account through the "Profile" tab on the PayPal website. I understand that removing the Account from the PayPal system does not cancel pending transfers that I have already initiated and authorized.</p><p>4.  Confirmation Period. PayPal agrees to provide written confirmation of this authorization at least three (3) days before the first PAD is debited from the Account. I acknowledge that this written confirmation can be provided via email.</p><p>5.  Sporadic PADs. PayPal is required to obtain authorization from me for each sporadic PAD. I acknowledge that to subsequently authorize sporadic PADs I must confirm my identity by entering a valid PayPal user ID and password at login or by through another reasonable method. This shall constitute valid authorization for my financial institution to debit the Account. </p><p>6.  Recourse. I have certain recourse rights if any PAD does not comply with this authorization. For example, I have the right to receive reimbursement for any PAD that is not authorized or is not consistent with this authorization. To obtain more information on my recourse rights, I may contact my financial institution or visit www.cdnpay.ca.</p><p>7.  Validation by Financial Institution. I acknowledge that my financial institution is not required to verify that a PAD has been issued in accordance with the terms of this authorization.</p><p>8.  Contract for Goods and Services.      Revocation of this authorization does not terminate any contract for goods or services that exists between me and any PayPal merchant or between me and PayPal. This authorization applies only to the method of payment and does not otherwise have any bearing on the related contract for goods or services.</p><p>9.  PayPal's Payment Service Provider. I acknowledge that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ("Wells Fargo"), holds an account with Royal Bank of Canada for the benefit of PayPal, and that Wells Fargo acts as the PayPal's payment processing representative for the transactions contemplated by this authorization. I agree that the information contained in this authorization may be disclosed to Royal Bank of Canada and/or Wells Fargo as required to complete any PAD transaction. I acknowledge that this authorization is provided for the benefit of PayPal and is provided in consideration of my financial institution agreeing to process debits against my Account in accordance with the Rules of the Canadian Payments Association.</p><p>10.  Rights of Dispute. I may dispute a PAD only under the following conditions: <br/>(i)     the PAD was not drawn in accordance with this authorization
