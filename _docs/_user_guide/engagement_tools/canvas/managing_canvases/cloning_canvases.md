# Cloning Canvases to Canvas Flow

By switching to the Canvas Flow workflow, you gain access to lightweight [Canvas components]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/canvas_components), [persistent entry properties]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/canvas/create_a_canvas/canvas_persistent_entry_properties/), and [post-launch editing]({{site.baseurl}}/post-launch_edits). If you have an existing Canvas from the original editor, you can clone this Canvas to create a copy in Canvas Flow. Your original Canvas will not be altered or deleted.

To clone your Canvas, first go to the Canvas dashboard. Next, identify the Canvas you want to create a copy of in the Canvas Flow workflow. You can clone Canvases with a **Draft**, **Active**, or **Stopped** status. Click <i class="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i> **More actions** and select **Clone to Canvas Flow**.

Next, enter the name for your new Canvas and click **Clone to Canvas Flow**.

Now, youâ€™ll have two versions of your Canvas: the original Canvas and the Canvas Flow version. Your original Canvas will still have a **Stopped** status, and the cloned Canvas will have a **Draft** status. You can still access the original Canvas, but Braze recommends using the Canvas Flow workflow to continue building your Canvases.

You've completed cloning your Canvas into the Canvas Flow workflow. Now, you can continue building your Canvases in this updated experience!

## Limitations

If your Canvas matches any of the following details, then your Canvas can't be cloned to Canvas Flow:

- Has Full Steps that have exception events or use the delay filter "in" or "on the next"
- Has a Full Step that branches out into multiple steps, and is not the first step of the Canvas
