# Automated user provisioning

To set up automated user provisioning, go to the **Company Settings** in the dashboard by expanding the options found by clicking your username. From there, go to **Automated User Provisioning** to begin setup. 

You will need to provide the following information to get your SCIM token:
1. Select a default app group for new dashboard developers to be added to. If you do not specify an app group in the [create users SCIM API call](/docs/scim/post/), they will be added here.<br><br>
2. Provide a service origin. The service origin is how Braze identifies where the request is coming from. <br><br>
3. Optionally provide a comma-separated list or range of IP addresses allowed for SCIM requests. The `X-Origin-Request` header in each request will be used to check the request IP address against the allowlist.

Once you have completed the required fields, you can generate a SCIM token and see your SCIM API endpoint. **This token will only be presented once.** Braze expects all SCIM requests to contain the SCIM API bearer token attached via an HTTP `Authorization` header.
