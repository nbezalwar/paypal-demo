# Link Shortening

> Link shortening and click tracking allow you to automatically shorten URLs contained in SMS messages and collect open-rate analytics, providing additional engagement metrics to help understand how your users are engaging with your SMS campaigns. 

{% alert important %}
Link Shortening is currently in early access. Please contact your Braze account manager if you are interested in participating in the early access.
{% endalert %}

## Overview

Link Shortening and click tracking can be enabled at the [message variant-level]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/engagement_tools/testing/multivariant_testing/#step-1-create-your-campaign) in both campaigns and Canvases. Links will be shortened using Brazeâ€™s shared short domain ([brz.ai](http://brz.ai)) with a length of between 20-21 characters. An example URL may look something like this: `https://brz.ai/8jshX`

Shortened URLs will be valid for one year from the date they were created.

To enable Link Shortening, ensure the Link Shortening toggle in the message composer is enabled.

For Braze to recognize URLs, they must start with _http://_ or _https://_. When a URL is recognized, the **Preview** pane will update with a placeholder URL. Note that the character count in the **Compose** tab excludes all personalization of link shortening.

{% alert note %}
Non-ASCII characters in URLs are currently not supported.
{% endalert %}

## Testing

We always recommend that you preview and test your message before launching a campaign or Canvas. 

Navigate to the **Test** tab to preview and send an SMS to [content test groups]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/developer_console/internal_groups_tab#content-test-groups) or an individual user. The preview will update with relevant personalization and the shortened URL. The number of characters and [billable segments]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/campaign/segments/) will also update to reflect the rendered personalization and the shortened URL. 

Make sure to save the campaign or Canvas before sending a test message to receive the shortened URL that will be dispatched in your message. If the campaign or Canvas is not saved before a test send, the test send will contain a placeholder URL.

{% alert note %}
Liquid personalization and shortened URLs are templated on the **Test** tab after a user has been selected. Ensure a user is selected to receive an accurate character count!
{% endalert %}

## Click tracking

When Link Shortening is enabled, the SMS and MMS performance table include a column titled **Total Clicks** that shows a count of click events per variant and an associated click rate. For more details on SMS metrics, see [SMS message performance]({{site.baseurl}}/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/sms/sms_campaign_analytics/#message-performance).

![][4]

The Historical Performance and SMS Overview chart also includes an option for  **Total Clicks** and shows a daily time series of click events.
