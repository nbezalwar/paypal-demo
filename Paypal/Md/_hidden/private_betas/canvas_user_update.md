# User Update 

![][1]{: style="float:right;max-width:45%;margin-left:15px;"}

The User Update component allows you to update a userâ€™s attributes, events, and purchases in a JSON composer, so there's no need to include sensitive information like API keys.

With User Update, updates don't count towards your users or track per minute rate limit. Instead, updates are batched so Braze can process them more efficiently than a Braze-to-Braze webhook.

Users will only advance to downstream Canvas steps after the relevant user updates have been completed. If your downstream messaging relies on the user updates that you are making, you can ensure that these updates have been completed prior to when the messages send.

{% alert important %}
User Update is currently in early access and only supported in Canvas Flow. Contact your Braze account manager if you are interested in participating in the Canvas User Updates early access. <br><br>Braze will begin to deprecate Braze-to-Braze webhooks that target the `/users/track` endpoint once this feature is generally available. We'll let you know about the full deprecation process and timeline when the User Update component is released so that you have the time and support from Braze to make the switch.

## Create a User Update 

To create a User Update step, add a component to your Canvas and select **User Update**. Then, add an attribute, event, or purchase JSON object to the JSON composer.

{% alert note %}
Do not include any of the following information in the JSON composer:
* External user ID
* API key
* Braze cluster URL
* Fields related to push token imports
{% endalert %}

As an example, users who receive the following User Update step will have the VIP Member attribute set to `true`.
