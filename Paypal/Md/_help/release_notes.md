### New Braze partnerships

With the Braze and [IAM Studio]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/email_templates/iam_studio/) integration, you can easily insert customizable in-app message templates into your Braze in-app messages, offering image replacement, text modification, deep link settings, custom attributes, and event settings.

#### actionable.me - Analytics

The Braze and [actionable.me]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/analytics/actionableme/) integration allows you to deploy a service to monitor your progress in the utilization of Braze. Through a combination of tools and processes, they will rapidly benchmark your CRM performance, identify new opportunities and provide recommendations on how to perform better.

#### Storyly - Cohort import

The Braze and [Storyly]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/cohort_import/storyly/) integration allows you to use your segments in Braze as an audience in the Storyly platform. With this integration, you can:

The Braze and [Quikly]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/additional_channels/retargeting/quikly/) partnership allows you to accelerate conversions on events within a Braze customer journey. Quikly does this by using urgency psychology to motivate consumers in fun — and instant — ways. For example, brands can use Quikly to immediately acquire new email and SMS subscribers directly into Braze or to motivate other key marketing objectives like downloading your mobile app.

#### DataGrail - Data privacy and compliance

The Braze and [DataGrail]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/data_privacy/datagrail/) integration allows you to detect consumer data collected and stored within Braze to quickly process DSRs (access, delete, and do-not-sell requests). Braze will be added to an accurate blueprint of where consumer data lives in your organization with automated data mapping — no more surveys or spreadsheets are needed to maintain a privacy framework or produce a record of processing activities (RoPA).

#### Snowplow - Analytics

The Braze and [Snowplow]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/analytics/snowplow/) integration enables users to forward Snowplow events to Braze through Google Tag Manager server-side tagging. The Snowplow Braze tag allows you to send events to Braze while offering additional flexibility and control:

#### Grouparoo - Workflow automation

The Braze and [Grouparoo]({{site.baseurl}}/help/release_notes/deprecations/grouparoo) integration makes it easy to operationalize data stored in a warehouse by sending it to Braze. When you set up automatic sync schedules, you can consistently enhance customer communications with up-to-date information.

#### Lexer - Customer data platform

The Braze and [Lexer]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/customer_data_platform/lexer/) integration allows you to sync data across the two platforms. Use your Lexer data to create valuable Braze segments or import your existing ones to Lexer to unlock insights.

#### Knak - Email orchestration

The Braze and [Knak]({{site.baseurl}}/partners/message_orchestration/channel_extensions/email_templates/knak/) integration allows you to create fully responsive emails in minutes or hours instead of days or weeks and export them as ready-to-use Braze templates. Knak is built for marketers who want to level up their email creation for campaigns managed in Braze, without the need for outside agencies or hand-coding.
